- front controller pattern
  -> a single servlet delegates responsibility for a request for actual processing. In Spring MVC, this is done by
  the DispatcherServlet
  
- The DispatcherServlet sends a request to a certain controller after consulting one or more Handle Mapper(s)

- At the controllers, the request drops off its payload and waits while the controller or business logic processes
what it needs.

- The logic returned is called the model, which then needs to be passed to the view so it can be returned to the user.
The controller packages the model data and sends it and the view name to the DispatcherServlet

- DispatcherServlet consults a view resolver that in turn maps the logical view name to a specific view implementation,
which may or may not be a JSP.

- The request's final step ends at the view to be rendered where it deliver's the model data used to render the view
via the response object.
