State Management -> the management of UI control input(s) with another control input(s)

HTTP Stateless Protocol -> the server is not required to track state over multiple requests, not that it can't do this

Front controller -> common web application pattern where a single servlet delegates responsibility for a request to other
components of an application to perform actual processing (in Spring, this is the DispatchServlet class)

Component-scanning -> tells the Spring the package where it can auto-discover beans

Application context -> the central interface within a Spring Application for providing configuration information

Bean -> just a standard for defining a class / a convention

<coolCode>EqualsBuilder and HashCodeBuilder</coolCode>
  -> ala Apache Commons Lang

JSTL -> JSP Standard Tag Library

Path parameter -> Whatever value is at the placeholder position in the request path will be passed into the handler
  method's variable parameter. The parameter is defined via a position in the URL path
  
Resource-orientation -> in this context, directly referring to a resource on a server vs. querying it in the URL (which
  requires an operation on that data to get to the resource)
