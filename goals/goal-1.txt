Outstanding questions
  - Is the order of development presented in the book the order that makes the most sense to me?

<after>5.2 -> IntelliJ needs you to configure the Application Context, just click on it and then ok,
this can be done manually as well, but following the prompt is easy</after>

What It Takes to Achieve - pt1

1.1 - Setting up Spring MVC
1.2 - Write a controller

<breakdown>My mental model for this exercise was based on creating other Java exercises. I click a
button, create a package, a class, and off I go! This past has lead me to underestimate the complexity
of building a web app.</breakdown>

<refresh>Use new source to build a web app project. If it doesn't work, find another that will. The
goal is to use Maven and Spring, anything else that has to be done is ok, but these are the focus.
Maven because it is easy to use for building web app. The goal is to understand what really needs to
happen to make a web app. IntelliJ will not save me and will only make things easier once I actually
know what I'm doing.</refresh>

1.3 - Accepting request input
1.4 - Process form
1.5 - Render view in Thymeleaf
